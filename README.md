# Authorship Obfuscation in Multilingual Machine-Generated Text Detection
Source code for replication of the experiments in the paper submitted to ACL Rolling Review.

## Install Dependencies
Each external obfuscator has each own requirements and dependencies that need to be installed from the corresponding repository. At least, install the dependencies of the original [MULTITuDE benchmark](https://github.com/kinit-sk/mgt-detection-benchmark), on which our study is built.

## Data
Firstly, the original unobfuscated data need to be downloaded from [MULTITuDE](https://zenodo.org/records/10013755) and put into the 'dataset/multitude.csv.gz' file. Afterwards, the obfuscated data can be generated by the provided scripts:

1. For backtranslation (to select m2m100 or nllb-200 model, just uncomment the corresponding model_name in the source code), use the provided [01_backtranslation.py](01_backtranslation.py).
2. For paraphrasing by ChatGPT, use the provided [01_chatgpt_paraphrase.py](01_chatgpt_paraphrase.py).
3. For paraphrasing by PEGASUS-paraphrase, use the provided [01_pegasus_paraphrase.py](01_pegasus_paraphrase.py).
4. For paraphrasing by DIPPER, use the source code provided in the original [DIPPER repository](https://github.com/martiansideofthemoon/ai-detection-paraphrases), while applying the settings mentioned in the paper.
5. For text edits by GPTZzzs, use the source code provided in the original [GPTZzzs repository](https://github.com/Declipsonator/GPTZzzs).
6. For text edits by GPTZero-Bypasser, use the source code provided in the original [GPTZero-Bypasser repository](https://github.com/jayyt12161/GPTZero-Bypasser).
7. For text edits by a generic HomoglyphAttack, use the provided [01_homoglyphattack.py](01_homoglyphattack.py).
8. For text edits by ALISON, use the source code provided in the original [ALISON repository](https://github.com/EricX003/ALISON), while applying the settings mentioned in the paper.
9. For text edits by DFTFooler, use the source code provided in the original [DFTFooler repository](https://github.com/jmpu/DeepfakeTextDetection), while applying the settings mentioned in the paper.

10. After the obfuscated data are generated, run the provided [02_text_quality.ipynb](02_text_quality.ipynb) Google Colab notebook to calculate and analyze various automated text similarity metrics between the original and obfuscated data.

## Fine-tuning
To fine-tune a base model for machine-generated text detection task, use the provided [03_finetune_detector.py](03_finetune_detector.py) script.

## Run Detection
To run statistical methods, use the [IMGTB framework](https://github.com/kinit-sk/IMGTB). To run pre-trained and fine-tuned methods, use the provided [04_test_detector.py](04_test_detector.py) script. Since the Longformer Detector requires a special pre-processing step, use the provided [04_test_longformer.py](04_test_longformer.py) instead.

## Results Analysis
To analyze the results, use the provided [05_results_analysis.ipynb](05_results_analysis.ipynb) Google Colab notebook.
